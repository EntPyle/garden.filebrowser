FileBrowser
======

The `FileBrowser` widget is an advanced file browser. You use it
similarly to `FileChooser` usage.

When opened, it provides a shortcut bar with links to special and system
directories. When touching next to a shortcut in the links bar, it'll
expand and show all the directories within that directory. It also allows
to specify paths to be added to the shortcuts list.

It provides a icon and list view to choose file from. And it accepts
filter and filename inputs.
